1. Client submits the MR job
2. YARN resource manager -> Allocates resources on the cluster
3. YARN node managers -> launch and monitor the compute containers
4. MR application master coordinates tasks running the MR job
    App Master and MR tasks run in containers

--------------

submission -> initialization ->

1. Submit() method -> creates jobsubmitter instance ->> calls submitJobInternal()

  jobsubmitter --> asks resource manager for new app ID
                   Computes input splits for the job
                   copy reources for the job
                      >> job jar copied with high replication factor(mapreduce.client.submit.file.replication = 10)
                   submits job using submitApplication()
