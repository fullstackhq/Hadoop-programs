HBase should be used when the big data application has –

1)A variable schema

2)When data is stored in the form of collections

3)If the application demands key based access to data while retrieving.

Key components of HBase are –

Region- This component contains memory data store and Hfile.

Region Server-This monitors the Region.

HBase Master-It is responsible for monitoring the region server.

Zookeeper- It takes care of the coordination between the HBase Master component and the client.

Catalog Tables-The two important catalog tables are ROOT and META.ROOT table tracks where the META table is and META table stores all the regions in the system.
